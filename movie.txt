That same morning, he received a cash envelope from an unknown person and an order to investigate Harlan's death.

-Goren agrees to participate in a certain experiment and soon comes to his senses in an almost empty room of level 48, where there are large rectangular openings in the floor and ceiling. At each level there are two people, and how many levels are unknown. A common well connects the floors, where once a day the platform lowers with food, and the lower the people are, the less chance they have of eating. Castling takes place every month, and the inhabitants of the upper levels may be at the very bottom, and vice versa. Since it was allowed to take one item with him, Goren chose a volume of Don Quixote, and his neighbor grabbed a large self-sharpening knife.
